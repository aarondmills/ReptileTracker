Reptile Genetics Tracking
=========================

I am interested in breeding ball pythons and other reptiles. This is a proof of concept application I am working on for the tracking of feeding schedules, cleaning schedules, and breeding records that can be passed out to clients who purchase snakes from me. I think people will appriceate good records, and breeders enjoy keeping good records.

If you like this idea and want to help me out feel free to shoot me an email at: aaron@jailbreakcreative.com
